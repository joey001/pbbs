<b>Sparse Matrix Vector Multiply (SPMV):</b> Given a sparse matrix in compressed sparse row format multiply it by a dense matrix. Input vector consists of n random values in [0...1).

    Inputs:
<ul>

   <li>Matrix generated from Rmat with n non-zeros and n/10 rows and columns. 

   <li>Matrix generated from nearest neighbor graph on n/10 points with 10 neighbors.

    </ul>
Output:
<ul>

   <li>The output vector

 </ul>
