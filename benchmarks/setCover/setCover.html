<h2>Set Cover (SC):</h2> 

The (unweighted) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem">set cover problem</a> is: given a set of sets S to find a
minimum sized subset T of S such that the union of elements in T
contains all elements in the union of elements in S (i.e. T covers all
the elements covered by S).  The set cover problem is NP hard and this
benchmark is to find an approximate minimum sized set cover.  The
maximum allowed size of the returned set cover is specified as part of
the data specification.

<h4>Input and Output Format</h4>

<p>
The input is represented as a bipartite graph in the in the <a
href="benchmarks/graphIO.html">adjacency graph</a> format.  Each
vertex represents a set and the integers included in each adjacency
list are the elements the set covers.  Let m be the maximum element
label in any of these adjacency lists.  Not all integers between 0 and
m need to be in a set, although it is assumed that the element labels
are relatively dense.  The output is a sequence of integers
corresponding to the sets included in the set cover (0 based).  The
output needs to be in the <a
href="benchmarks/sequenceIO.html">sequence</a> format.  The vertex
indices need not be sorted in the output.

<h4>Distributions</h4>

<p>
Each distribution should be run for <tt>n=10,000,000</tt>.  
The weights
used for average time are given in parentheses (all equal).
</p>

<ul>
<li>
(1) Random local graph with approximately 10 edges per vertex.  This
graph is generated so that the probability of each edge out of a
vertex is biased to nearby vertices.

<blockquote>
<tt>randLocalGraph -j -d 3 -m &lt;5*n&gt; &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt><br>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
(1) An RMAT graph with parameters (.3,.1,.1,.5) and about 5n edges.

<blockquote>
<tt>rMatGraph -j -a .5 -b .1 -m &lt;5*n&gt; &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt><br>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
(1) A 3 dimensional grid.
<blockquote>
<tt>gridGraph -j -d 3 &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt><br>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
