<h2>Dictionary (DICT):</h2> 

<p>
This benchmark measures the performance of batch inserting, deleting and
searching elements with a dictionary data structure.   Each element
must support auxiliary data, and the benchmark assumes that
the elements have three associated functions:
<menu>
<li> A hash function that maps each element to an unsigned integer
<li> A comparison function that compares two keys, and
<li> A function that compares two elements with equal keys, giving
them a total order based on their auxiliary data.
</menu>
The third function is used to decide what element to keep when elements
with equal keys are inserted (the element with higher priority is kept).
The specific benchmark batch inserts a sequence of values, then batch deletes
another sequence of values, and finally batch searches a sequence of values.
All three sequences can have repeated keys.
</p>

<p>
The code must not take advantage of the specific type beyond the
functions for hashing and comparing.  If the size is used the
benchmark should be reported with -Z.

<h3>Input and Output File Formats</h3>

<p>
The input and output should be in the <a
href="benchmarks/sequenceIO.html">sequence</a> format.  For testing
the input sequence needs to be partitioned into three equal length
parts, the first used for insertion, the second for deletions (after
the insertions), and the third for searches (after the insertions and
deletions).  If the input length is not divisible by 3, then the
number of insertions and deletions need to be of length floor(n/3) and
the remaining elements are searches.  Note that if the elements
consist of both a key and auxiliary data, then the auxiliary data for
the deletions and for the searches is ignored.  The output sequence
consists of the results of all successful searches, including both the
key and the carried data.  The output sequence should be in the same
order as the searches in the input sequence and any repeated
successful searches should be included at each occurrence.
</p>

<h3>Default Input Distributions</h3>

Each distribution should be run for <tt>n=10,000,000</tt>.  The weights
used for average time are given in parentheses.
<ul>
<li>
(1) 32-bit unsigned integer keys from the uniform distribution.
<blockquote>
<tt>randomSeq -t int &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
(1) Integer keys randomly and uniformly selected from the range [0..100000).
<blockquote>
<tt>randomSeq -t int -r 100000 &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
(1) 32-bit unsigned integer keys from the exponential distribution.
<blockquote>
<tt>exptSeq -t int &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
(3) strings selected from the trigram distribution.
<blockquote>
<tt>trigramSeq &lt;n&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
(3) strings selected from the trigram distribution tagged with
auxiliary 32-bit integers.  The priority on the auxiliary integers for
equal keys is to keep the higher valued integer.
<blockquote>
<tt>trigramSeq &lt;n&gt; &lt;tmpname&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>addDataSeq -t int &lt;tmpname&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</tt><br>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
